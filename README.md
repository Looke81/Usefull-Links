Poppendieck: Learn Agile Software Development
? The True Story of a Death March Project, Part 4: A Solution Emerges CH 2 P 44-45 
  The development team had to update the database.
  Many disagreements on how to do it.
  Mary had everyone come up with ideas and slowly get to the right one.
  The solution in the end was novel and worked on day 1.
? Delaying Decisions Hewlett-Packard CH 3 P 53-54
  Delayed decision for printer configuration. Despite being more to configure in warehouse rather than factory they had better idea of the number of units that have been sold meaning there was less waste by more effectively matching supply to demand. HP saved 3Million 
? The US Marines CH 3 P 62-64
  Marines specialize in chaos
  Settle on a plan with 70% chance of success
  Very agile
  When mission starts everyone is a leader
  Not trained how to do a job just told what needs to be done
  Hierarchy is split into many small teams like scrum
  Everyone on the “front line” has autonomy and can make informed decisions
? CMM CH 5 P 97
  Instead of dictating the direction of the project from the top down, the development team should be responsible for their own actions to give them the power on how they are going to deliver and add value to the customer. By pushing the decisions lower down, they get closer to the actual customer level.
? CMMI CH 5 P 98-99
  Capability Maturity Model Integration
  Based on two assumptions:
  Work should be separated into workable chucks (User stories to tasks)
  A mature organization is one in which everything is carefully planned and then controlled to meet the plan.
 CMMI is more results oriented
? The NUMMI Mystery CH 5 P 99-101
 In 1982, a General Motor car factory based in California shut down as a result of basing their business on a top down management scheme. From a lack of productivity and quality as well as staff members regularly not attending, they were forced into recruiting 20 percent more workers than what was actually required in order to ensure that an adequate labour force was supplied. The number of unresolved complaints often exceeded 5,000. Two years later the same organisation reopened by NUMMI, New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., with 85 percent of the employees being recruited back from the previously fallen business. The number of employees choosing not to work was now down to 3 percent with substance abuse being a minimal problem. Come 1991 after 8 years in operation the number of filed complaints was at 700, with 90 percent of the employees describing themselves as “satisfied” or “very satisfied”. General motors did waterfall approach and Toyota was doing an Agile approach. Went to a constant improvement appr oach rather than checking at the end.
? Work-Out CH 5 P 102-103
 Another improvement process
 Is different from the others as it gets the managers to listen to feedback from workers
 Managers must give a yes or no to every suggestion
 Mary was teaching a manager that just told workers what to do 
 His workers where more experienced than him
 Got him to treat workers like volunteers at his choir
 The Ill will gradually dissipated and project was a success 
? Master Developers CH 5 P 112-113
 Mater developers refer to someone who is extensively experienced in their field. Their role is essential. In self organising teams, a master developer should emerge naturally. Their knowledge means they are respected by the development team. They are able to communicate and demonstrate their technical knowledge to the development team. They lead the team whilst communicating their ideas across. They can drill down to the complexity and detail of both the developers and the customers. They abstract the system to a high level of detail.
? Perceived Integrity: Google CH 6 P 129- 13
 Mary likes google
 Google has so many great features she didn’t even know she wanted
 Because of this google high perceived integrity
 Perceived integrity is similar to market share
 Lots of people use google so it must be easy to use, safe and secure.
? Tool 20: Testing CH 6 P 145-146
 Videocassettes, consists of 15 assembly steps. After every step, a test is performed to make sure parts are put together correctly and no misalignments. When a product passes these tests, you can ensure that it was constructed based on how it was designed. For videocassettes, tests are performed to ensure that functionality is performed correctly for example, smooth and high quality play back in various different playback machines. 
 In software development, tests are used to ensure that design intent is achieved, and the system does what the customers want it to do and it is fit for purpose. For any system there should be tests for each feature to ensure that each feature fits together and functions correctly. There are three types of testing, unit tests, system tests, and integration tests. Developer tests is another name for them, ie assure code does what the developer intended it to do. Customer tests is another name for making sure that a system does what the customers expect it to do.
 Tests communicate how a system should work, provide feedback on a system and provides scaffolding and foundations for developers to make changes throughout the development process.
? Five Whys CH 7 P 154-155
 Enables you to find root cause of a problem 
 You ask why the problem has occurred 5 times
 e.g: 
 1.	Why? – The battery is dead. (First why)
 2.	Why? – The alternator is not functioning. (Second why)
 3.	Why? - The alternator belt has broken. (Third why)
 4.	Why? – The alternator belt was well beyond its useful service life and not replaced. (Fourth why)
 5.	Why? – The vehicle was not maintained according to the recommended service schedule. (Fifth why, a root cause

 Kaizen means “continuous improvement.” Kaizen culture is one where individuals feel empowerment and act collaboratively. Kaizen culture has a high degree of social culture and trust.

? Chapter 15 Page 172-174 – The Napa Project
 Local application estimated to take 13 months, pressure on an early release. Chose 4-week iterations. New versions every 2-weeks would have been too much for the environment. Couldn’t use too much of their time. Get more users to experiment and better feedback. Little overhead, critical project so high visibility, maintained priorties, and everyone was aware of initial release date for urgency.

? Chapter 15 Page 174 - The Goodman Project
 Commercial application. 2-week iterations with a targeted 6-month release. Uncertainty. Not much feedback as users were internal and clients were overseas. Priorities weren’t constant and feedback wanted as often as possible therefore the smaller iterations suited it better. Helped them keep focus on getting the software delivered as soon as possible.

 As a <user type>, I want to <goal> so that <reason> 
 1)	Thinking about different scenarios for a problem, i.e what a user wants before a game, during a game, after a game. 
 2)	Story points – estimation on how weighted the user stories and tasks are towards the overall problem. 
 3)	Questionnaire on how users feel about proposed functionalities. 
 4)	Define hours to spend on each task and then add up for how much time should be spent during an iteration. 
 5)	Gathering feedback from users and clients for the prototype and then work on that feedback in order to improve on or alter any features/tasks. 
 6)	Repeat the process and re-estimate.
 Chapter 11 Page 111-120 – Prioritisation Desirability
 Grouping features into three categories:
 -	Threshold, or must-have features
 o	Features that must be present for the product to be successful,
 -	Linear features
 o	“The more, the better”, Customer satisfaction related to the quantity of the feature. The more features performed, the more it satisfies the customers.
 -	Exciters and delighters
 o	Provide great satisfaction but also don’t have a specific need or purpose

 List all the roles on cards remove duplicate/similar roles
 Add detail to role cards general factors you should include:
 •	The frequency with which the user will use the software.
 •	The user’s level of expertise with the domain.
 •	The user’s general level of proficiency with computers and software.
 •	The user’s level of proficiency with the software being developed.
 •	The user’s general goal for using the software. Some users are after convenience, others favor a rich experience, and so on.
 Figure out which users must be satisfied with the product first
 Create hypothetical users to fit these roles for easy communication e.g “Bob the teacher, Jeff the schools admin etc”
? Page 209-216 – Estimating
 To estimate how long a story will take you can play a game of planning poker where each person gives a task an amount of effort points and you come to an agreement as a team on each task’s difficulty.
? Page 223-229 – Acceptance tests
 Acceptance tests determine whether or not the story has been completed to a satisfactory level.
? Chapter 4 Page 45-52 – Techniques, user stories applied
 User stories can be found by interviewing users, observing users, questionnaires, and holding story-writing workshops. The best results are achieved by using a combination of methods rather than overreliance on any one method. The most useful answers are given in response to open-ended, context-free questions, such as “Tell me about how you’d like to search for a job” rather than “Will you search for a job by title?”
 Agile: Size or scope is negotiable (Fixed cost)
 Waterfall: Cost is negotiable (Fixed size/scope)
